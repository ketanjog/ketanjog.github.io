## About My Academic Interests
Hi! I'm Ketan, a student at Columbia University. I completed my B.A in Math-Statistics at Columbia College, and am currently a senior doing a B.S in Computer Science at the Columbia Engineering School. Check out some of the interesting [classes]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses) I've taken so far!

I'm passionate about projects in Computational Biology, Reinforcement Learning, Blockchain technology, and most of all AGI - creating synthetic intelligence capable of generalising its learning abilities across environments and tasks. Read more about my [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research), and [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).

## Who am I otherwise

I'm largely addicted to coffee, and cannot start my day without a hot cup made from freshly ground beans. I try different varieties, with a non-decaying, constant rate of exploration.

I love playing the acoustic Guitar, especially fingerstyle. I'm a fitness enthusiast, and I want to get more into adventure sports (next on the list is scuba-diving 😀 ). Poker is one of my favorite ways to relax after a long day, as is reading a nice book.

I'm involved with the Columbia Poker Club, CU-EA (effective altruism) and the Columbia Blockchain Reading Group.

I'm a CBA distinguished bartender and love making whisky drinks 🥃.
